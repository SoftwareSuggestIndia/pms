## 🏨 Introduction to Jhattse
Jhattse (a term derived from the Hindi word for "quickly/instantly") is an all-in-one cloud-based hospitality operating system. Unlike legacy enterprise systems that are often bloated and expensive, Jhattse focuses on speed of execution, ease of use, and mobile-first management.

### Target Audience
- Independent Business Hotels (10–100 rooms)
- Boutique Resorts
- Serviced Apartments
- Guest Houses and Bed & Breakfasts

## 🛠 Core Product Modules

### 1. Smart Property Management System (PMS)
The heart of Jhattse is its intuitive "Tape Chart" interface. It handles:
- **Instant Check-In/Check-Out**: Digital documentation capture (Aadhaar/Passport) for local compliance.
- **Dynamic Room Mapping**: Real-time visibility of Clean, Dirty, and Under-Maintenance rooms.
- **Folio Management**: Automated split-billing and corporate credit tracking.

### 2. Intelligent Channel Manager
Jhattse eliminates the risk of overbooking by providing:
- **Real-time Inventory Sync**: Instant updates across Booking.com, Expedia, Agoda, and MakeMyTrip.
- **Rate Parity Control**: Ensuring the same price is maintained across all platforms to avoid OTA penalties.

### 3. Integrated Booking Engine
A direct booking tool that converts a hotel's website into a revenue-generating platform, reducing reliance on high-commission OTAs.

## 🚀 Technical SEO & Digital Presence
For modern hoteliers, "being found" is as important as "being efficient." Jhattse incorporates several features that assist in Search Engine Optimization (SEO):

- **Schema Markup Integration**: The booking engine uses structured data (JSON-LD) so that Google Search can display prices and availability directly in search results.

- **Mobile-Ready Design**: Responsive booking interfaces that cater to the 70%+ of travelers who book via smartphones.
